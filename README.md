# Medical Entity and Relation Annotation Tool

This project is a web-based tool for medical experts to annotate medical entities and relationships in clinical narratives. The annotations can be exported for use in healthcare NLP model training and evaluation.

For deeper technical details (architecture, data model, extensibility), see [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md).

## Live Demo (AWS App Runner)
Running instance (ephemeral demo environment):

UI: https://ifk8vjymp2.ap-southeast-2.awsapprunner.com/ui/

Health check: https://ifk8vjymp2.ap-southeast-2.awsapprunner.com/health

Note:
- Cold start right after a new deployment may take ~30–60s.

## Quick Start (Local with Docker)

Prerequisites: Docker Desktop.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build and start the backend container:
	```powershell
	docker compose up --build
	```
3. Verify health endpoint:
	```powershell
	curl http://localhost:8000/health
	```
4. Explore the autogenerated docs (FastAPI): http://localhost:8000/docs
5. (Optional UI) Open interface: http://localhost:8000/ui/
6. Load sample abstracts (first time only; POST or simple GET):
	```powershell
	curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/bootstrap
	# or
	curl http://localhost:8000/bootstrap
	```
7. Explore the controlled vocabulary: http://localhost:8000/vocab
8. List loaded documents:
	```powershell
	curl http://localhost:8000/documents
	```
9. (Optional) Get heuristic suggestions for a document:
	```powershell
	curl "http://localhost:8000/suggest/entities?doc_id=abstract1"
	```
10. (Optional) Stop containers:
	```powershell
	docker compose down
	```

## API Summary (Backend)
Endpoints:
- POST /documents
- GET /documents
- GET /documents/{id}
- POST /documents/{id}/entities
- POST /documents/{id}/relations
- GET /documents/{id}/export
- GET /export/all (aggregate export of all documents)
- POST /import (upload JSON export)
- GET /health
- GET /vocab (controlled entity/relation types)
- POST /bootstrap (ingest raw abstracts into documents)
- GET /suggest/entities (heuristic entity suggestions)
- POST /save/all (force save all documents)
- DELETE /documents/{id}/entities/{entity_id}
- DELETE /documents/{id}/relations/{relation_id}
- PATCH /documents/{id}/status (body: {"status":"completed" | "in_progress" | ...})

Example workflow (single document):
1. POST /bootstrap
2. GET /documents -> pick an id (e.g., abstract1)
3. Add entity:
	```powershell
	curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/documents/abstract1/entities ^
	  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
	  -d "{\"start\":0,\"end\":12,\"text\":\"Hypertension\",\"type\":\"Disease\"}"
	```
4. Create relation (needs two entity IDs — retrieve via GET /documents/{id}):
	```powershell
	curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/documents/abstract1/relations ^
	  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
	  -d "{\"source_entity_id\":\"<eid1>\",\"target_entity_id\":\"<eid2>\",\"relation_type\":\"treats\"}"
	```
5. Export annotated document:
	```powershell
	curl http://localhost:8000/documents/abstract1/export
	```

Persistence: documents auto-save to data/annotations/*.json after create, entity add, relation add, or import. Bootstrap reloads saved JSON if present.

## Web UI Usage

Open http://localhost:8000/ui/ after the container is running. Then:

1. Click "Bootstrap Documents" to load sample abstracts (first run).
2. Choose a document from the drop-down.
3. Highlight text in the Document Text panel; click "Add Entity". It appears in the Entities list and is highlighted in the text.
4. To create a relation: check exactly two entity checkboxes, pick a relation type, click "Create Relation".
5. Click "Suggest Entities" to fetch heuristic suggestions; press "Add" on any suggestion to accept it.
6. Click "Export JSON" to view the current document's raw annotation JSON in the Export panel.
7. Press "Save All" anytime to force persistence of all loaded documents (auto-save also happens on each add action).
8. Remove an entity or relation using the small ✕ button (after deletion re-select entities if creating a relation).

Status messages appear at the top; all saved JSON files land in `data/annotations/`.

## Sample Annotation JSON

Excerpt of a persisted document file (`data/annotations/abstract1.json`):

```json
{
	"id": "abstract1",
	"text": "Hypertension remains a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Amlodipine, ...",
	"status": "in_progress",
	"entities": [
		{"id": "4195...46b9", "start":0, "end":12, "text":"Hypertension", "type":"Disease", "annotator": null, "timestamp": "2025-08-22T10:09:36.680464"},
		{"id": "eeca...2a98", "start":75, "end":85, "text":"Amlodipine", "type":"Medication", "annotator": null, "timestamp": "2025-08-22T10:09:38.476035"}
		// ... more entities ...
	],
	"relations": [
		{"id": "af84...261f", "source_entity_id": "4195...46b9", "target_entity_id": "eeca...2a98", "relation_type": "causes", "direction": "forward", "annotator": null, "timestamp": "2025-08-22T10:13:51.157282"},
		{"id": "73c5...be7f1", "source_entity_id": "eeca...2a98", "target_entity_id": "56b4...9e57", "relation_type": "treats", "direction": "forward", "annotator": null, "timestamp": "2025-08-22T10:18:43.106154"}
		// ... more relations ...
	]
}
```

(IDs truncated for readability.)

## Cloud Deployment (AWS App Runner)

The live demo runs on AWS App Runner (container direct from ECR). steps:

1. Build & tag image locally:
	- docker build -t annotation-tool:latest .
2. Push to ECR (create repo `annotation-tool` if needed) then tag & push.
3. In App Runner: Create service → Source: Amazon ECR → pick repository + tag `latest`.
4. Set port 8000 and environment variables:
	- APP_ENV=prod
	- APP_ANNOTATOR=demo (optional)
5. Enable automatic deployments from ECR.
6. (Optional) Health check path /health.

Teardown: Delete App Runner service → (optional) delete ECR images/repository.

Cost / limits: Small size (1 vCPU / 2GB) keeps costs low; scale-out occurs automatically on load. No persistent volume attached—export data before redeploy.
